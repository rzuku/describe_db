# Description

It has occured on one of the project, that the DBs structure was completely not documented and I was working on investigation and lookin for a coleration for tables in general by field name.  

# Describe tables structure for MySQL
So then I created this python script/program which connects to a DB nad descibes the structure of the tables ot files.
Each table has its own output file names like the table name.

You can get the structure of tables of either provided DB or all DBs or DBs like %db%.
